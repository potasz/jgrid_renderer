Distributed renderer based on Sunflow and JGrid v0.1.2
------------------------------------------------------

This software kit enables the distributed rendering of 3D models building on a number of open source technologies that are all implemented in 100% pure Java. The rendering engine is the Sunflow (http://sunflow.sourceforge.net) open source rendering system for photo-realistic image synthesis, built around a flexible ray tracing core and an extensible object-oriented design. The distributed computations are managed by the JGrid (http://pds.irt.vein.hu/jgrid) service-oriented Grid system that uses the Jini (http://www.jini.org) technology as its base. 

Please read the documentation in the "doc" directory for more details about the installation and setup. Or visit the http://sfgrid.geneome.net web page for a more up to date version.
